# The scene:
## A side on shot of a rider crossing vast swathes of rolling farmland on horseback, his steed shines with sweat. 
Narrator: Behold Veritus, trusted retainer of King Romulus, and his valiant steed Ubiquitous, mighty champion of equine kind!  Together they strive furiously across the Kingdom of Lathe. But what could drive man and beast so?  And to where could they be going? 
## Background scrolls to a wooded hill 
### slight zoom on the rider's satchel during this part
Narrator: Ah, we see they carry a desparate missive laden with dire tidings.  
### zooms back out
Though they are weary, their duty drives them ever on. 
## scrolls through wooded hills
Across the breadth of the Mauthen Lands... 
## Fades to black
## Fades in on Veritus walking, leading the exhausted Ubiquitous up a winding, defensible path.  The camera slowly pans up to center on a massive stone fortress
... and into the very halls of Fort Mauthen itself!

## Fades to black
## Fades in on the great hall of Fort Mauthen.  Veritus is giving his report to the Lady Mauthen
The Dark Lord has arisen and is rallying his forces! King Romulus summons his retainers... to WAR!
## Fades to black
## Fades in on Lady Mauthen and her three sons.  Each of the sons departs as they are named
Lady Mauthen orders her sons to rally their own retainers.  Seamus, the youngest, she sends West to her most wealthy vassals. They'll not be able to fool his keen senses with their merchant wiles!  Rudolph, the middle son and most physically powerful, she sends North to the mountain lords.  They, constantly under threat from the Icemen, will send the fewest warriors but more than they might out of respect for Rudolph's martial prowess. Anton, the eldest, she commands to stay and administer the lands.  Of all her sons, the Alemdraught burns strongest in him. Should the worst come, Anton alone will defend the Mauthen lands.
